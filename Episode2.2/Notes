using parcel we built our app
Another way of bring react into our project via npm
Earlier we use cdn link to bring react into our project but it is not a prefered way to bring react and reactDOM into our project. why?
because fetching from cdn is costly operation ,it will get react from unpkg network. If i already have react in my node module then it would
be easy to use. basically we donot want to make another network call into our project

To bring react into npm we write
npm install react
npm i react-dom
i is the short from of install

start server

npx parcel index.html
