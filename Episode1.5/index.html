    <!-- Order of files matter a lots in react -->
    <!-- summary of the episode 1 -->
    <!-- First we write just hello world program using just html
        second we also saw how we write same html file using javascript. 
        Third we saw how we can bring react into our code. [using cdn link we do that]
        react is object at the end of the day then using reactdom we create root then we render root and it is
        super powerful it is helping us to put the object into the html tag
        createElement api takes three argument 1)name of the tag 2)object-attribute of the element 3)The children first child is normal react element
        second is if we have to give multiple element the pass child into an array
        if there exist anything inside the root then it is going to be replaced.
        but if there are anything before and after the root then in that case we can still use react in root.
