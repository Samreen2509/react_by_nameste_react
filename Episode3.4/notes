What is component in react?
Two type of component in raect
1) Classbased component - It is a old way- it uses javascript class based component
2) functional component - new way - It uses javascript function based component

What is react functional component?
It is just a normal js function, which return some piece of jsx.

Note:- Whenever you are creating any functional comp or react comp just name it as a capital letter otherwise you will get an error.
e.g. const = Heading = () => {
    return <h1> nameste </h1>;
}
A function which is returing some piece of jsx is called functional comp.

If we have only one line to return we can write like this both function are same

const = Heading = () => <h1> nameste </h1>;

const = Heading = () => (
     <h1> nameste </h1>;
)
 Render functional component

 root.render(<Heading />);
